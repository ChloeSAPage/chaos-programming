# Animal Chaos!

## Description

Ever wanted to see an animal on a screen? Well lucky for you we have tailor-selected 24 animals that we can show you! Please visit [Animal Chaos](https://chaos-animals.netlify.app/) to see the best of the best!

## What we did.

Animal chaos is a chaotic take on pair-programming. Eight individuals discussed, debugged and developed this website using React.js. We were on a synchronous call developing the site using the perspective of 8 full-stack engineers. After developing a rigorous structure and foundation, we worked asynchronously on branches with effective communication and workflow. 

## What is it?

It is a single page application where you have a list of many animals that have been converted from JSON data. You are able to search through them using the input to find the specific animal you want!

When the page initially loads, only 6 animals are present, however, if you click the **show more** button, it will display an additional 6. If you keep clicking, it will show the maximum amount of animals until the number disappears

There is a counter keeping track of how many animals are present on the page.

### What we used 

- Props
- useState()
- Array filtering and mapping
- Manipulation of JSON date
- Creating reusable components
- Styling react components
- Modular CSS
